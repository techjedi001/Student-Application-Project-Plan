<h1>Student Progress Monitoring Through Campus Meal Plan Application</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>


<b>Project Overview:</b>
   - The project aims to develop a new application that monitors students' progress through their campus meal plans using their "foodcard." The project follows a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and has a comprehensive project plan. The current phase involves three critical steps: gathering and managing requirements, creating an initial system model, and developing a vulnerability map. The scope of my duties and what will be highlighted in this project included the following; overall network and system requirements, secure configurations to system components, cardholder data encryption during transmission, requirements and priorities, application architecture, and application components requirements. 

**Key Steps:**

1. **Gather and Manage Requirements:**
   - **Security and Compliance:** Ensure that all security requirements are met and that compliance requirements are specified.
   - **Process Demonstration:** Provide examples of requirements management processes and include a final requirements document detailing the requirements, their priorities, and their sources.
   - **Functional Requirements:** 
     - Enable students to pay for meals at all campus food and retail outlets.
     - Authenticate students via student ID and PIN or ID card and PIN.
     - Allow students to access a web page to view balance, review purchase history, and add funds.
     - Enable campus student services admins to view balances and generate monthly statements.
     - Provide a "low balance" alert to students.
     - Generate reports for campus admins on foodcard expenditures at all campus facilities.
     - Transfer funds to the respective store/restaurant bank accounts weekly.

   - **Nonfunctional Requirements:** Specify performance, usability, reliability, and other nonfunctional aspects.

2. **Create Initial Model:**
   - Develop a comprehensive model of the system, detailing all major modules and interfaces.
   - Ensure the model aligns with the gathered requirements, covering both functional and nonfunctional aspects.

3. **Develop Vulnerability Map:**
   - Using the system model, identify and rank potential vulnerabilities.
   - Consider the model within the context of the requirements to ensure all vulnerabilities are addressed.

**Additional Requirements and Testing:**
- Based on the vulnerability map, identify any additional requirements needed to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Develop test cases to verify that vulnerabilities are mitigated by the end of the development phase of the SDLC.

**Deliverables:**
- **Final Requirements Document:** Including functional and nonfunctional requirements, priorities, sources, and essential data.
- **System Model:** Detailed and comprehensive, covering all major modules and interfaces.
- **Vulnerability Map:** Identified and ranked potential vulnerabilities.
- **Test Cases:** Developed to ensure vulnerabilities are mitigated.

**Individual Contribution:**
Each team member will include a paragraph at the end of the report detailing their specific contributions to the project.

**Functional Requirements Summary:**
- Students can pay for meals at all campus facilities.
- Authentication via student ID and PIN, or ID card and PIN.
- Web page for students to view balance, review purchase history, and add funds.
- Campus admins can view balances and generate monthly statements.
- Low balance alert for students.
- Reports for campus admins on foodcard expenditures.
- Weekly fund transfers to store/restaurant bank accounts.
